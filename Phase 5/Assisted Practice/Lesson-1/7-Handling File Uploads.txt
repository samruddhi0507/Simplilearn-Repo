This section will guide you to:
●	How to upload the Desktop file in selenium WeDriver

Development Environment
●	Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers Version Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a)
●	Java Development Kit Version 8
●	Selenium standalone server
●	Autoit

This guide has mainly Two subsections, namely: 
1.7.1 Handling File Upload by SendKeys
1.7.2 Handling File Upload by AutoIT script
1.7.3 Pushing the code to GitHub repositories
	
Step 1.7.1: Handling File upload by SendKeys
●	Open Eclipse
●	Create a project : Click on file->New->Java project
●	Enter project name as UploadFile 
●	Click on Finish
●	In the project explorer, Expand UploadFile
●	Right click on src and choose New->Class
●	In Package Name, enter com.ecommerce and in Name enter Upload and click on Finish
●	Locate the browse button using chropath/firebug.
●	Set the path using SendKeys. And the code looks like below

//Locating 'browse' button
 WebElement browse =driver.findElement(By.id("uploadfile"));
 //pass the path of the file to be uploaded using Sendkeys method
 browse.sendKeys("D:\\SoftwareTestingMaterial\\UploadFile.txt");


Step 1.7.2: Handling File Upload by AutoIT script
●	To open it go to Start->Autoit v3->Autoit window info
●	Now drag the Finder tool box to the object in which you are interested


 

●	Build an AutoIT script using SciTE editor and write the script using ControlFocus, ControlsetText, and ControlClick  commands.
●	And the script looks like below

 

●	Save the Script with .au3 extension.
●	Compile the .au3 script which converts it into .exe file.
●	Pass the .exe path into selenium test script using method
             Runtime.getRuntime().exec(“C:\AutoIt\Autoitscript.exe”)
●	Complete script looks like this


import java.io.IOException;
 
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
 
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
 
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
 
import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;
 
public class AutoIt {
 
 private static WebDriver driver = null;
 
 public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
 
     driver = new FirefoxDriver();
 
     driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 
     driver.get("http://toolsqa.com/automation-practice-form");
 
     driver.findElement(By.id("photo")).click();
 
     Runtime.getRuntime().exec("D:\AutoIt\AutoItTest.exe");
 
     Thread.sleep(5000);
 
     driver.close();


Step 1.7.3: Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories
Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
Initialize your repository using the following command:
git init
Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add . 
Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m “Changes have been committed.”
Push the files to the folder you created initially using the following command:
git push -u origin master
