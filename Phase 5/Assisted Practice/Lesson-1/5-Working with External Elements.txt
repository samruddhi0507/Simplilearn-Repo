Assisted Practice: 1.5 Working with External Elements

This section will guide you to:
●	How to handle External elements using Selenium.

Development Environment
●	Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers Version Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a)
●	Java Development Kit Version 8
●	Selenium standalone server Version 3.141.59

This lab has mainly three subsections, namely:
1.5.1 Handling External pop ups.
1.5.2 Handling new Tabs and new Windows.
1.5.3 Pushing the code to your GitHub Repository.

Step 1.5.1: Handling External pop ups.
●	WebDriver does ability to interact with multiple windows,which includes alerts using the method switchTo. This method allows to switch the control to pop-up while keeping the browser open in the back ground.
●	Open Eclipse
●	Syntax for handling the various pop ups
●	To click on ‘OK’ button in pop up
Syntax: WebDrive driver = new chromeDriver();
driver.switchTo().alert().accept();
●	To click on ‘Cancel’ button in pop up   
Syntax: WebDrive driver = new chromeDriver();
driver.switchTo().alert().dismiss();
●	To Capure the alert message
Syntax: WebDrive driver = new chromeDriver()
driver.switchTo().alert().getText();
●	To enter the information
Syntax: WebDrive driver = new chromeDriver()
driver.switchTo().alert().sendKeys(“text”);
●	To exit from the popup
Syntax: WebDrive driver = new chromeDriver();
driver.switchTo().alert().close();

Step 1.5.2: Handling new Tabs and new Window.
●	Opening new tab
Syntax: WebDrive driver = new chromeDriver();
		  driver.findElement(By.id(“xyz”)).sendKeys(Keys.CONTROL + “t”);
●	Opening new Window
Syntax: WebDriver driver = new chromeDriver();
driver.findElements(By.id(“xyz”).sendKeys(Keys.CONTROL + “w”);


Step 1.5.3: Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories
●	Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
●	Initialize your repository using the following command:
git init
●	Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add .
●	Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m “Changes have been committed.”
●	Push the files to the folder you initially created using the following command:
git push -u origin master
