Assisted Practice: 3.2 Change the Volume Size of an Instance

This section will guide you to:
●	Change the volume size of an instance

This lab has seven subsections, namely:
3.2.1 Creating the new volume which we want to add to an instance and clicking on create volume
3.2.2 Validating the Availability zone of the EC2 instance with which you want to add volume
3.2.3 Providing type, size, availability zone, and snapshot name on the create volume tab
3.2.4 Selecting newly created volume and clicking on the action to attach the volume to the instance
3.2.5 Selecting the instance of the same availability zone and attaching the volume in pop
3.2.6 Verifying the instance by adding one more device to the block device
3.2.7 Pushing the code to GitHub repositories

Note: By default, when we create a new instance, we need to attach the minimum volume to the instance depending on the OS or AMI. But we can also add or remove the volume.


Step 3.2.1: Creating the new volume which we want to add to an instance and clicking on create volume

 


Step 3.2.2: Validating the Availability zone of the EC2 instance with which you want to add volume

 


Step 3.2.3: Providing type, size, availability zone, and snapshot name on the create volume tab

 


Step 3.2.4: Selecting newly created volume and clicking on the action to attach the volume to the instance

 


Step 3.2.5: Selecting the instance of the same availability zone and attaching the volume in pop
 


Step 3.2.6: Verifying the instance by adding one more device to the block device

 



Step 3.2.7: Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories
●	Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
●	Initialize your repository using the following command:
git init
●	Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add .
●	Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m “Changes have been committed.”
●	Push the files to the folder you initially created using the following command:
git push -u origin master
