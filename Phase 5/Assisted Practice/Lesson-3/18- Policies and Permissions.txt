Assisted Practice: 3.18 Policies and Permissions

This section will guide you to: 
●	Implement policies and permissions on an S3 bucket

This lab has three subsections, namely:
3.18.1 Creating a bucket
3.18.2 Adding policies
3.18.3 Pushing the files to GitHub repositories

Step 3.18.1: Creating a bucket
●	Create a new bucket in which we want to add policy with all default settings.

 

●	Click on the Permission section.
●	Go to Bucket Policy.
●	It will open the console where you can add policy.


Step 3.18.2: Adding policies
●	Click on the Policy Generator.
 

●	Select the type of policy and services required.

 



●	Add ARN for S3 to add the policy.
 

●	Click on policy generator to create the JSON of the policy.

 


●	Copy the generated JSON.

 

●	Paste the JSON in the policy console of bucket and click on Save. 

 


Step 3.18.3: Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories
●	Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
●	Initialize your repository using the following command:
git init
●	Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add .
●	Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m “Changes have been committed.”
●	Push the files to the folder you initially created using the following command:
git push -u origin master
