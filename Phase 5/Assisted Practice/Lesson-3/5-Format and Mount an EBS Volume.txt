This lab has four subsections, namely:
3.5.1 Attaching an existing EBS volume
3.5.2 Mounting the EBS volume
3.5.3 Unmounting the EBS volume
3.5.4 Pushing the files to GitHub repositories

Step 3.5.1: Attaching an existing EBS volume
●	Select an existing volume and click on Attach Volume
●	Select the instance

 

Step 3.5.2: Mounting the EBS volume

	sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
●	Use the following command to format the volume to ext4 filesystem:
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
●	Use the following command to create a directory to mount the volume:
sudo mkdir /newvolume
●	Use the following command to mount the volume:
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /newvolume/
●	Check the disk space using the following command:
cd /newvolume
df -h .


Step 3.5.3: Unmounting the EBS volume
●	Use the following command to unmount the volume:
umount /dev/xvdf

Step 3.5.4: Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories
●	Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
●	Initialize your repository using the following command:
git init
●	Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
