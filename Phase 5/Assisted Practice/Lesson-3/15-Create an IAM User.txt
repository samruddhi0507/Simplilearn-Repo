Assisted Practice: 3.15 Create an IAM User

This section will guide you to:
●	Create an IAM user
●	Validate the newly created IAM user

This lab has five subsections, namely:
3.15.1 Selecting the IAM from the AWS Console
3.15.2 Navigating to the user creation page 
3.15.3 Changing access permissions
3.15.4 Adding an identifier 
3.15.5 Pushing the files to GitHub repositories

Step 3.15.1: Selecting the IAM from the AWS console

●	Login to your AWS console and search for IAM

 


Step 3.15.2: Navigate to the user creation page

●	Click on Users to redirect to the user creation page to create IAM users 

 


Step 3.15.3: Changing access permissions

●	Add username in the User name* section. Select AWS Management Console access and select one of the ways to configure console password 
 
●	Either we can add user to the created group or we can add policy as shown below:

 

●	In case a user needs to add a policy first, then he or she needs to search and then add policy to the user 

 

Step 3.15.4: Adding an identifier
●	Add an identifier by adding key and value to tag each user as shown below:
 
●	Finally, it will create a user with a group or an added policy
 

●	On successful user creation, a URL will be created with which a user can login as an IAM user

 

●	The newly created user will be available on the dashboard as shown below:

 

●	By clicking on each user, you can see the key sign in the URL

 

●	By selecting a user, you can add that user to a particular group 

 


Step 3.15.5: Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories
●	Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
●	Initialize your repository using the following command:
git init
●	Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add .
●	Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m “Changes have been committed.”
●	Push the files to the folder you initially created using the following command:
git push -u origin master
