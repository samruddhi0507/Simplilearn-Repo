Assisted Practice: 3.1 Launch and Connect to an EC2 Linux Instance

This section will guide you to: 
●	Launch and connect to an EC2 instance

This lab has three subsections, namely:
3.1.1 Launching an EC2 instance
3.1.2 Connecting to the EC2 instance
3.1.3 Pushing the files to GitHub repositories

Step 3.1.1: Launching an EC2 instance
●	Go to Amazon dashboard
●	Select EC2
 
●	Click on launch instance to run any instance
 
●	Select the AMI 
 
●	Select t2.micro as the instance type
 
●	Specify the number of instances, networks, placement groups, and IAM roles and click Next
 
●	There is one volume attached to the instance by default
●	 In Linux, the default volume attached is 8 GB 
●	You can add more volume if required
 
●	You can add a key-value pair to the instance
 
 
●	Attach the three policy groups depending on the type of access required
 
●	Select an existing key-value pair to launch the instance
 
 
●	The instance is ready to use
 
●	Click on Connect on EC2 dashboard
●	 Run the ssh command provided
 
 

Step 3.1.2: Connecting to an EC2 instance
●	Run the following command to launch a website over EC2:
 yum install httpd -y
 
●	Navigate to /var/www/html and create index.html file using command 
vi index.html
 
●	Enter I and start creating HTML file content
●	Once done, type :wq!

 
●	Using public IP of EC2 instance, you can see your app running on the browser
 
 


Step 3.1.3: Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories
●	Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
●	Initialize your repository using the following command:
git init
●	Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add .
●	Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m “Changes have been committed.”
●	Push the files to the folder you initially created using the following command:
git push -u origin master
